🌩️ Yell At The Clouds As A Service

    YATCaaS — Because sometimes you just need to let the heavens know how you really feel.

😂 Why this project exists
Are you tired of serverless functions that aren't functionless?
IoT devices smarter than your toaster but dumber than a potato?
This tool gives you the ultimate power to yell your frustrations into the clouds.
Our Server forwards your scream to a real human intern (we call them "Cloud Yellers") who physically goes outside, shakes their fist at the sky, and shouts your message.
They won’t answer, but then again neither will your houseplants.
