## 😂 Why This Project Exists

* Sick of “serverless” functions that still cost you a kidney?  
* IoT gadgets smarter than your toaster yet somehow dumber than a potato?  
* Need a safe outlet for the primal scream you’ve been bottling up since high school chemistry?  

**YATCaaS** forwards your anguish to a real, live human intern (codename: **Cloud Yeller**).  
Said intern sprints outside, shakes a fist at the sky, and bellows your message until the neighborhood dogs file noise complaints.  
Will the clouds respond? Absolutely not. Then again, neither will your houseplants.

🌧️ FAQ <sub>(Frequently Angered Questions)</sub>
<details> <summary><strong>Q: Can I yell at specific cloud types?</strong></summary>

Absolutely! Our interns offer targeted shouting packages for:

    Stratus — low, grey, and already depressed.

    Cirrus — fancy ice-crystal wisps that need humbling.

    Cumulonimbus — the gym-bro of clouds. Yell loud or get thunder-splained.

</details> <details> <summary><strong>Q: Do clouds ever yell back?</strong></summary>

Technically yes. The medical community calls it “thunder.” Earplugs sold separately.
</details> <details> <summary><strong>Q: How do I know the intern actually yelled?</strong></summary>

Trust us, the HOA fines are proof enough.

📜 License

Provided as-is. No warranties. No shame. No guarantee the clouds won’t descend in protest.
TL;DR

Yell at the sky with majestic slowness → Get a courteous non-reply → Feel oddly satisfied → Repeat until inner peace (or laryngitis).

Disclaimer: If the clouds do respond, ping us. We may have accidentally triggered Ragnarok.
