## 🌩️ Yell At The Clouds As A Service (YATCaaS)  
### *Because shouting into the void is so 2023*  

**Finally!** A service that solves humanity's *real* problems: Unheard grievances with floating water vapor.  

---

### 🤬 Why This Exists 
- Your therapist charges $200/hour. **Clouds work for free.**  
- Alexa ignores you. **Siri judges you.** **Clouds... well, they just float there judging silently.**  
- We outsourced catharsis to minimum-wage interns with megaphones. *You're welcome.*  

> "I've yelled at 37 clouds this week and still got rained on. 10/10 would recommend."  
> *— Satisfied Customer*

### ☁️ How It Works (Spoiler: It Doesn't)  

1. **You**: Feed your rage into our JSON-shaped scream funnel  
2. **Us**: Pay an intern $3.50 to shout it skyward while dodging bird poop  
3. **Clouds**: Continue existing. *Majestically.*  

```python
# Your input (angrily typed)
await tool.yell_at_the_clouds("WHY MUST YOU RAIN ON MY PARADE LITERALLY?!")

# What happens next:
# 1. We calculate dramatic pause (0.5s per character)
#    → "WHY MUST YOU..." = 37 chars → 18.5 seconds of ✨suspense✨
# 2. Intern sprints outside (trips on stairs)
# 3. Megaphone feedback screeches
# 4. Pigeons scatter
# 5. Clouds: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

# Output: 
# 'your string "WHY MUST YOU..." has been yelled at the clouds. They remain unbothered.'
```
