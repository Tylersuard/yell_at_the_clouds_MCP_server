## 😂 Why This Project Exists

* Sick of “serverless” functions that still cost you a kidney?  
* IoT gadgets smarter than your toaster yet somehow dumber than a potato?  
* Need a safe outlet for the primal scream you’ve been bottling up since high school chemistry?  

**YATCaaS** forwards your anguish to a real, live human intern (codename: **Cloud Yeller**).  
Said intern sprints outside, shakes a fist at the sky, and bellows your message until the neighborhood dogs file noise complaints.  
Will the clouds respond? Absolutely not. Then again, neither will your houseplants.

## 🚀 What It Does

| Feature | Description |

| **`yell-at-the-clouds`** | The one and only tool. Perfection needs no entourage. |
| **Input** | Any string you can type while sob-crying. |
| **Dramatic Tension** | Waits `0.5 s × len(message)` (max 30 s) before replying, because suspense. |
| **Output** | `your string <your message> has been yelled at the clouds.  The clouds do not respond.` |
| **Refund Policy** | 😂 |

🌩️ Yell At The Clouds As A Service

YATCaaS — Because sometimes you just need to let the heavens know how you really feel.

😂 Why this project exists

IoT devices smarter than your toaster but dumber than a potato?
This tool gives you the ultimate power to yell your frustrations into the clouds.

They won’t answer, but then again neither will your houseplants.

Accepts a string as input.
Waits 0.5 seconds per character (capped at 30s) to simulate dramatic tension.

Returns:
your string <your message> has been yelled at the clouds.  The clouds do not respond.
No refunds, no responses.
